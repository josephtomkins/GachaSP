# GachaSP
A collection of current and past GachaSP versions

In this collection are the STL files for each previous iteration of the GachaSP for those of you who would like to print your own replacement parts, it also includes links to the PCBway community page where you can order replacements 
or order CNC manufactured pieces if you would like to make changes.

I'll try to be concise with the compatability of each part from each iteration as there have been a few and some changes make parts incompatible with others.

I will also list notable improvements on various models where applicable, but for the best support and largest range of compatability with after market parts and screens, always use the latest version. 

I am not liable for any damage caused to your console in attempting to do this mod.
